## hey, i'm Monesh ðŸ‘‹

i'm a frontend engineer passionate about crafting scalable, performant web applications with **React**, **Next.js**, and **TailwindCSS**. i love focusing on **frontend architecture**, **developer experience**, and **performance optimizations**, ensuring clean and efficient code thatâ€™s easy to maintain and delightful to use.

currently, i'm working at **ScoreMe Solutions**, a fintech startup where i build and maintain web applications for banking platforms. one of my key contributions here has been building a **JSON Path Maker** from scratch â€” a tool that helps users extract precise JSON paths based on their inputs, improving productivity and ease of use for internal teams.

my current stack includes **React**, **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, and **shadcn/ui**, with a growing interest in building internal tools and improving DX.

iâ€™m especially interested in:
- frontend performance tuning
- building devtools that improve workflows
- UI/UX systems and design consistency

outside of work, i spend time exploring better ways to enhance developer productivity, contribute to side projects, and level up my skills as a frontend specialist.
