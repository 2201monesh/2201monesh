## hey, i'm Monesh ðŸ‘‹

I'm a frontend engineer passionate about crafting scalable, performant web applications with **React**, **Next.js**, and **TailwindCSS**. I love focusing on **frontend architecture**, **developer experience**, and **performance optimizations**, ensuring clean and efficient code thatâ€™s easy to maintain and delightful to use.

currently, I'm working at **ScoreMe Solutions**, a fintech startup where I build and maintain web applications for banking platforms. One of my key contributions here has been building a **JSON Path Maker** from scratch â€” a tool that helps users extract precise JSON paths based on their inputs, improving productivity and ease of use for internal teams.

I primarily work with react, next.js, tailwindcss, and shadcn/ui. I'm deeply interested in frontend performance tuning, building devtools that improve workflows, and crafting ui/ux systems with strong design consistency. Outside of work, I often explore new technologies, experiment with side projects, and continue growing as a frontend specialist.
